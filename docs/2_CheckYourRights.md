[DISCLAIMER](#disclaimer)

# 2) Check your permissions and rights
Before attempting to make your work open access you may wish to:
1. Consult with superiors, co-workers/co-authors to see what their opinion is on sharing the scholarly works openly.
2. Check your rights and permissions. Some publishers or journals do not permit the open sharing of works. Therefore you need to check your rights before proceeding to share your work.

You can do the above for each of the item in your list of works. You can also check if your institute (or the institute of one of your co-workers) has an overarching [Open Access License](#oalicense) which enables you to share works.    

Checked your rights? Ready for the [next step]({{ site.baseurl }}/3_UploadYourWork)?  

## How to check your rights?
If you are at a university your librarian may be able to advise and inform you about your rights for a given publisher/publication. You can also check yourself since most publishers list their policies on their website.   

## Quickly check your rights for published articles
Depending on the journal you may or may not be able to share the [pre-print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint), [post-print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprint), or published article form of your article. The site [Sherpa Romeo](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) may also be a helpful resource since you can search individual journals and quickly get insight into sharing rights.    
<a href="http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/sherpa_logo.png" width="30%" alt="Sherpa Romeo"> </a>

For instance searching for _"Journal of Biomechanics"_ provides us with:   
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jbiomechRights.png" width="50%" alt="Rights">    

While searching for _"Journal of Biomechanical Engineering"_ provides us with:   
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jBiomechEngRights.png" width="50%" alt="Rights">      

Therefore, using this system you can quickly get an idea of the rights for a particular journal. However, this may not be the complete story as the institute you work for might have its own policies or licenses in place to help enable open access sharing. Consult your legal department or a librarian for more information.

## Institute wide open-access policies affecting your rights  <a name="oalicense"></a>
Some institutes have an over arching open-access license. In some cases these automatically apply, while in other cases individual researchers may opt-in. An example of such an institute wide policy is [MIT's opt-in OA license](https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/mit-open-access/opt-in-oa-license/). If you (or one of your co-authors!) is covered under such a license you may be able to share your works irrespective of the sharing policies of the individual journals. Consult your librarian for more information and to check if your institution has such an open access license policy in place.
