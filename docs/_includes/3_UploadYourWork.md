Identified suitable repositories? Uploaded all your works? Let's move to the [next step]({{ site.baseurl }}/4_GetRecognition).

## What repository to choose?
There are many different types of repositories for your content. Your repository of choice may depend on the type of content (e.g. articles, data, or code) and on the particular discipline. If you are at a university your librarian may be able to advise your. Here is a list of repositories (and pre-print servers) per discipline: [Disciplinary repositories](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Disciplinary_repositories).   

Repositories like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) can house any type of content, offer long term and stable storage, and provide a DOI, allowing one to cite your works.

Tip:
1. Click [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) to learn how to automatically push GitHub content to Zenodo to make it citable.    
2. If you have made unpublished works available through online repositories you can likely automatically list them on ORCID. For instance repositories like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) provide a DataCite type DOI for your shared content, since DataCite is an ORCID member organization you can incorporate content with DataCite DOI's easily (more on that [here](https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/188278-import-works-website-user)).
