Now that you've shared all your content it would be good to announce your efforts to the rest of the world. Post links to the openly available works on social media and on your personal and institutional websites where possible. However, it is also possible to create a list, similar to the list of your ORCID profile, providing links to all your shared works. One system that allows for this is [ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org/) (click on impactStory profiles on that page).

## ImpactStory
ImpactStory (see also the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImpactStory)) _"ImpactStory is an open source, web-based tool that provides altmetrics to help researchers measure and share the impacts of all their research outputsâ€”from traditional ones such as journal articles, to alternative research outputs such as blog posts, datasets, and software. It aims to change the focus of the scholarly reward system to value and encourage web-native scholarship."_.     

In short ImpactStory allows you to:
1. Link to ORCID and import the list of all your works
2. Add the open access link for others to obtain access to each item in the list
3. Keep track of altmetrics (e.g. social media shares) associated with your works

Tip:
1. As you add open access links to all your works ImpactStory lists the percentage of your works that are now open access and provides a badge to accompany your open access efforts. Once you have made 100% of your work open access you join the ranks of open access heroes:    
<a href="http://impactstory.org/"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/impactStoryScreenShot.png" width="25%" alt="ImpactStory"> </a>
2. Similar to your ORCID profile link, you can also use create a single link to all your open access content (which you could for instance incorporate on your website or in your e-mail signature), e.g.:   
<a href="https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0003-3768-4269/publications" ><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Impactstory-logo-2014.png" style="width:2em;margin-right:.5em;" alt="ImpactStory">impactstory.org/u/0000-0003-3768-4269</a>   
The code for this link looks like:   
```html
<a href="https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0003-3768-4269/publications" ><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Impactstory-logo-2014.png" style="width:1em;margin-right:.5em;" alt="ImpactStory">http://impactstory.org/u/0000-0003-3768-4269</a>   
```   
You can also embed the list in your own website. For instance you can incorporate the following HTML code:     
```html
    <iframe   src="https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0003-3768-4269/publications" width="100%" height="1000" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
```
